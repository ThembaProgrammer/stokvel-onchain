## 🎯 Overview

The **StokvelInvestmentGroup** smart contract enables groups to pool funds, make collective investment decisions, and track shared asset ownership using blockchain technology. Each ERC1155 token ID represents a unique asset owned by the group, with members holding tokens proportional to their investment share.

### What is a Stokvel?

A Stokvel is a traditional South African savings scheme where members regularly contribute to a common pool, which is then used for collective investments, purchases, or distributed among members. This smart contract brings this concept on-chain with:

- **Transparency**: All transactions recorded on blockchain
- **Democracy**: Proposal-based decision making with weighted voting
- **Automation**: Smart contract enforces rules automatically
- **Security**: Non-custodial, member-controlled funds
- **Fractional Ownership**: ERC1155 tokens represent asset shares

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤝 Democratic Governance
- **Proposal System**: Members propose investments, new members, or fund distributions
- **Weighted Voting**: Voting power based on member's share balance
- **Configurable Quorum**: Adjustable voting thresholds (default 51%)
- **Multiple Proposal Types**: Asset purchases, sales, member management, distributions

### 💰 Financial Management
- **Pooled Contributions**: Members contribute ETH to common fund
- **Share-Based System**: Proportional ownership tracking (1 ETH = 1000 shares initially)
- **Minimum Contributions**: Configurable entry requirements
- **Profit Distribution**: Automated proportional payouts to members

### 🏠 Asset Management (ERC1155)
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Each token ID represents a unique asset
- **Asset Types**: Real Estate, Stocks, Cryptocurrency, Business, Other
- **Value Tracking**: Monitor asset appreciation/depreciation over time
- **Fractional Ownership**: Members hold tokens proportional to their shares in each asset

### 🔐 Security Features
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (ADMIN_ROLE, MEMBER_ROLE)
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards on all fund transfers
- **Pausable**: Emergency stop mechanism for critical situations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checks on all operations
- **Auditable**: Full event logging for transparency

## 🔄 How It Works

### Phase 1: Formation & Setup
```solidity
// 1. Deploy contract with parameters
StokvelInvestmentGroup stokvel = new StokvelInvestmentGroup(
    "My Investment Stokvel",  // Name
    "ipfs://metadata/",        // Metadata URI
    0.1 ether,                 // Minimum contribution
    7 days,                    // Voting period
    51                         // Quorum percentage
);

// 2. Founder automatically becomes first member and admin
// 3. Add initial members via adminAddMember() or proposals
```

### Phase 2: Member Contributions
```solidity
// Members contribute ETH to the pool
stokvel.contribute{value: 1 ether}();
// - First member: 1 ETH = 1000 shares
// - Later members: shares proportional to pool size
// - All contributions tracked transparently
```

### Phase 3: Asset Investment
```solidity
// 1. Member proposes asset purchase
uint256 proposalId = stokvel.proposeBuyAsset(
    0.5 ether,
    "Downtown Apartment",
    "Prime location real estate investment"
);

// 2. Members vote (voting power = their shares)
stokvel.vote(proposalId, true);  // Vote in favor

// 3. After voting period, if approved, execute
stokvel.executeProposal(
    proposalId,
    "Downtown Apartment",
    "Real Estate",
    "ipfs://asset-metadata/"
);
// Result: Asset created with unique ID, ERC1155 tokens minted to all members
```

### Phase 4: Asset Management
```solidity
// Monitor and update asset values
stokvel.updateAssetValue(assetId, 0.8 ether);

// When profitable, propose sale
stokvel.proposeSellAsset(assetId, 0.9 ether, "Time to exit");
// After approval, asset sold and proceeds added to pool
```

### Phase 5: Profit Distribution
```solidity
// Admin initiates distribution
stokvel.distributeProfits();
// Each member receives: (their shares / total shares) × pool balance
```

    signer
);

// Make a contribution
await contract.contribute({ value: ethers.parseEther("1.0") });

// Get your member info
const [contributions, shares, percentage, joinedAt, isActive] = 
    await contract.getMember(yourAddress);

## 🔒 Security

### Security Features Implemented

✅ **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with OpenZeppelin AccessControl
✅ **Reentrancy Guard**: Protection on all fund transfer functions
✅ **Pausable**: Emergency pause mechanism for critical situations
✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checks (zero addresses, minimum values, etc.)
✅ **Overflow Protection**: Solidity 0.8+ built-in protection
✅ **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

### Security Audit Status

⚠️ **Pre-Audit Phase**: This contract is in development and has NOT been professionally audited.

**Before Mainnet Deployment:**
1. ✅ Code review completed
2. ✅ Unit tests (100% coverage)
3. ⚠️ Professional security audit (REQUIRED)
4. ⚠️ Multi-signature admin wallet setup
5. ⚠️ Monitoring and alerting system
6. ⚠️ Emergency response procedures

### Known Considerations

See [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](./SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for detailed analysis:

- **DoS Risk**: Unbounded loops in profit distribution (recommend pull-based pattern for large groups)
- **Oracle Dependency**: Asset valuation is centralized (recommend Chainlink integration)
- **Front-Running**: Proposal voting susceptible to front-running (time locks can mitigate)
- **Gas Costs**: Large member counts increase gas costs (pagination recommended)
